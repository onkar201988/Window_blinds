# Window_blinds
This firmware is used in custome hardware board with ESP8266 12F board communicating with DRV8825 stepper driver board to open or close the window blinds using stepper motor.
The stepper motor is attached to a cutome made ball chain gear, and it drives the ball chain attached to the windows blinds to open or close them.

The command to the driver is given via MQTT message from OpenHab server. So user can use his/her cellphone or shout to Alexa to open or close the window blinds. :-)
